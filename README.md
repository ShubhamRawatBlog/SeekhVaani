# Experiment Branch

Welcome to the Experiment branch of SeekhVaani!

This branch is designated for local experiments and testing. Changes made in this branch are not intended for immediate collaboration or merging into the main project. It serves as a sandbox for trying out new ideas, features, or modifications.

## Purpose

The Experiment branch allows us to:
- Test new concepts and features locally.
- Experiment with changes without affecting the main project.
- Iterate and refine ideas before integration.

## Guidelines
- Changes in this branch are for personal exploration.
- Avoid merging this branch into the main branch.
- Document your experiments for future reference.

## Notes
- This branch is not for production use.
- Share insights or interesting findings in the project's discussion or documentation.

Happy experimenting!
